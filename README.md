# Wedding

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Inspiration
There are many wedding websites out there, but they tend to be basic and often buggy. My fianc√©e and I wanted something more customizable, allowing us to modify all aspects of the pages and include logic for inviting different parties to the ceremony, reception, and show.

The front-end is built using Angular 15+ with extensive use of TailwindCSS. The page features a smooth forward-motion effect on scroll, both on mobile and desktop, eliminating the need for routing. API calls are made to save each RSVP, with names predetermined and sent to each guest, who can log in securely.

The data is pulled and saved in SQL on a hidden Wedding API project.
