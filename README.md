# Wedding

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Inspiration
The number of wedding websites out there are basic enough but buggy. My fiance and I wanted something where we could modify all the aspects of the pages and include logic when inviting different parties the ceremony, reception and show. The front-end is created using Angular 15+ with extensive use of TailwindCSS. No routing required as page has a smooth forward-motion effect on page scroll, both on mobile and desktop. There are API calls made to save each of the RSVP's. The RSVP names are predetermined and sent out to each guest and only they know their login. The data is pulled and save in SQL on a hidden Wedding API project.
