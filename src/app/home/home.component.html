                    <div>e are thrilled to invite you to our Las Vegas Wedding! We encourage all of you to take this opportunity and make this
                        into a small getaway or a
                        full blown vacation.

                </div>
                <br />Since we will not have a wedding party, we decided to have our guests show up in style and be the “wedding party”. Choose any shade of
                purple
                for any piece of clothing or accessory. Feel free to show up decked out in purple as well :)
                <br />
                <br />Hope you're as excited as we are to make lasting memories!
                <br />
                <br />XOXO
                <br />
